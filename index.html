    <h1>What I Eat When My Wife's Not Home</h1>
    <img src="./img/homealone.jpg">
    <p>I've been learning to code for about a week now, and am already more comfortable behind the keyboard than I have ever been in the kitchen. If there has ever been anyone capable of burning ice, I am probably that guy. When I was single, I single handedly kept all of the fast food restaurants within a 5 mile radius of my apartment in business. But since marrying my wife, the constant fast food hunt for survival is no longer necessary, as she spoils me with <strong> delicious</strong> home made meals every day.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there are times when my wife leaves me home alone. When this happens, I am forced to fend for myself, which lets be honest, typically means I hop in my truck and find the nearest possible fast food burger. Every once in a while though, I muster the courage to try to make my own meal... and the results are predictably sad.</p>
    <p>Follow the below links to find the top 3 meals that I am brave enough to try to make without supervision.</p>

    <ul>
        <h2><li><a href="./recipes/icecream.html">Ice Cream Sundae</a></li></h2>
        <h2><li><a href="./recipes/cereal.html">Cereal</a></li></h2>
        <h2><li><a href="./recipes/pbj.html">Peanut Butter and Jelly</a></li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>None of the pictures you will find on this website were taken by me. Why would I use someone else's pictures for my work, you ask? The simple answer is that I don't photograph my food, for multiple reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My food rarely looks appealing (Trust me, these pictures are prettier)</li>
            <li>I rarely use my camera in general. While most people's camera rolls are filled with pictures of loved ones and beautiful scenery, mine is nothing but faucet parts and broken sewer lines (I'm a plumber by trade)</li>
            <li>If I am making my own food, chances are that I think I am starving and about to die (<em>I'm not</em>), and in the immortal words of Sweet Brown, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEoMO0pc7k">"Ain't Nobody Got Time for That"</a></li>
