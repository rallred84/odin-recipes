    <h2>About this Recipe</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't like cereal? Not only is it easy, delicous and <em>sometimes</em> nutricious, but there are literally 10,000 different kinds to choose from, so you can have something "new" every single day!</p>
    <p>This is one of those meals that I like so much, I may even make it when my wife is still home.</p>
