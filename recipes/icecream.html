    <h2>About this Recipe</h2>
    <p>You might think I am crazy putting ice cream on my list of meals. You are probably thinking, "Ice cream does not count as a meal, you <em><strong>monster!</strong></em>" And on most days, I would absolutely agree with you.</p>
    <p>However, this recipe website isn't for most days. This website is for days where my wife leaves me home to fend for myself. On those days, we feast on junk!</p>
